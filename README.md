## Week 1
### Keys

- Binary safe: string, integer, float, object â€¦, max size 512M

- Common used:
  - SET
  - GET
  - DEL/UNLINK
  - EXPIRED

  - LPUSH, RPUSH
  - LPOP, RPOP

### Sets

- Common used:
  - SADD
  - SPOP
  - SMEMBERS
  - SREM
  - SDIFF diff elements from the first SET to follow SET

### Sorted Sets

- Multi elements can have the same score.
- Common used:
  - ZADD
  - ZRANK range is Zero bases.
  - ZREVRANK//redis.io/commands/hget/): Return the value associate with field in the hash stored at key.
## Week 2
### Capped Collections & Set Operation
